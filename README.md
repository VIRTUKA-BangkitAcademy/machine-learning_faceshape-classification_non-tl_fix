# The Dataset
To perform facial classification, we utilized a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rafdigilbert/faces99), which comprises six facial types. These facial types are categorized as follows: diamond (0), oblong (1), oval (2), round (3), square (4), and triangle (5).
